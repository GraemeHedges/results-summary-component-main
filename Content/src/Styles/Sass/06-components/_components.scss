// Style rules for UI components

// A Component is a single element of UI that can be seen and interacted with.

// Components are self-contained, meaning they’re are selfish little buggers. They’re only concerned with
// themselves and everything within. They don’t have any influence on anything that happens outside of their
// little world.

// A great example of a component would be a button.
